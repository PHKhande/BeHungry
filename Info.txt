1. What is Emmet?
Emmet is a web development tool that enables faster HTML and CSS coding by providing a shorthand syntax with 
abbreviations and shortcuts to generate complex structures with ease.

2. Difference between a Library and Framework?
A library is a collection of functions or modules providing specific functionalities, allowing developers to 
use only what they need. A framework is a more comprehensive toolset that provides a complete architecture, 
conventions, and dictates the flow of control, guiding developers in building applications.

3. What is CDN? Why do we use it?
A CDN (Content Delivery Network) is a distributed network of servers located globally. It delivers web content, 
like images and scripts, closer to users, improving performance, reducing server load, and increasing scalability for websites.

4. Why is React known as React?
React is known as "React" because it efficiently reacts to changes in data and updates the user interface (UI) 
accordingly. The name emphasizes the library's core principle of reactive rendering and updating.

5. What is crossorigin in script tag?
`crossorigin` is an HTML attribute used in the `<script>` tag for loading external JavaScript files with 
Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) requirements. It specifies how the browser should handle loading the 
script from a different origin securely.

6. Difference between react.development.js and react.production.js files via CDN?
`react.development.js` is an unminified, larger version of React for development with helpful error messages.
`react.production.js` is a minified, smaller version optimized for production, without error messages, improving performance for end-users.

7. What is async and defer?
`async` and `defer` are attributes used in the `<script>` tag to control how external JavaScript files are loaded and 
executed in an HTML document. `async` allows the script to download asynchronously while the rest of the HTML content loads, 
executing immediately after it's fetched. On the other hand, `defer` also loads the script asynchronously, but it ensures 
the script is executed in order after the HTML document is fully parsed. The choice between `async` and `defer` depends on 
whether the script has dependencies on other scripts or the DOM, determining when it should be executed during the 
page loading process.
